# MakeDesktop v1.0

This is my first submitted program online, I hope this program will help people simplify making their desktop file executable.

To run the program, go to the 'dist' folder, right-click, open the terminal here.

And type in 'java -jar MakeDesktop.jar'.

This program requires Java JRE of minimum JDK 1.7.

p/s : I am new to github, if there is some issue with the repos, please tell me. I'm still learning :)

Regards,
